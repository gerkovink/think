# Introduction to gen AI

## What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** refers to a subset of artificial intelligence technologies capable of generating new content, ideas, or data that resemble human-like outputs. 

  - Generative AI operates through advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning networks. 
  - These models are trained on large amounts of data in a specific domain (e.g., text, images, video) and can then generate new outputs based on the patterns and features they have learned.

Some common examples of generative AI technologies include:

- Chatbots and virtual tutors: AI-driven chatbots can provide personalized tutoring, answering student questions and offering explanations on a wide range of subjects.

- Content creation tools: Tools like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) can assist in creating educational content, generating lecture notes, or drafting exam questions based on certain criteria.

- Automated essay scoring and feedback: AI models can grade essays and provide feedback to students on their writing.

## How Do AI Tools Work (in 10 steps)?

1. Machine learning enables computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with varying levels of human intervention.
2. Machine learning methods often work by means of training, for example to perform a single task or set of tasks.
3. Some forms of models are not specifically programmed to perform certain tasks and learn withouth human intervention. 
4. The domain of machine learning that focuses on such human brain-like deep learning strategies is called neural networks (NNs).
5. Transformers ([Vaswani et al. 2017](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html)) are a type of neural network that have advanced deep learning, particularly in the domain of natural language processing.
6. Instead of modeling words one after another, transformers can look at whole sentences or paragraphs at once and take the context of text into account. 
7. It is not hard to imagine that contextual understanding allows for better learning and more flexible applications.

8. Generative AI tools, such as Gemini, chatGPT or GitHub Copilot are applications of transformers.
9. These tools have been trained on extremely large amounts of data (mostly text) and have learned from the structure, meaning and nuances of the language.
10. After training, these tools can generate new text that both coherent an contextually relevant.

## Who develops generative AI tools

- Generative AI technologies are often developed by publicly traded companies with:
    - Deep pockets
    - Shareholders
    - Motives and goals that may diverge from academic or public interests

- These technologies also require significant computing resources for training and operation
  - This skews access and development to those with substantial resources.
  - If you feel sad or overwhelmed by the low sense of control, read [Choose Your Weapon:
Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10458714)

# Impact of generative AI

## Impact on education

There is a finite number of options for dealing with generative AI in education. These options translate to the following *stages of AI grief*:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **Ignore** the existence of generative AI
2. **Forbid** the use of generative AI
3. **Circumnavigate** generative AI by using offline assessment modes like pen/paper exams or oral exams
4. **Test around** Let students perform tasks that generative AI struggles with
5. **Embrace** generative AI and allow it in course work
6. **Rethink** the way we assess students and develop new assessment methodologies

## Impact on society
- There is also a societal impact of generative AI technologies 
  - They can create divides and inequality
  - There is [evidence](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/) that the workers who curate these models are treated unfairly or even inhumanely by their employers. This [interview from last month](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2024/03/25/madhumita-murgia-ai-can-do-harm-when-people-dont-have-a-voice/) also paints a good picture of how and where AI work can harm people.
  
- The energy consumption required for training generative models contributes to carbon emissions. 
  - This also holds for interacting with and applying these models
  - There is already a larger than necessary hidden carbon footprint

- The Dunning-Kruger effect

# Policy

## Current at our university
- [UU policy](https://intranet.uu.nl/generatieve-ai-in-het-onderwijs/generatieve-ai-faq)
- [UMCU: Guidelines for GSLS students](https://students.uu.nl/en/gsls/practical-information/generative-ai-guidelines)
- [UMCU: GenAI guidelines for research projects for students and supervisors](https://students.uu.nl/sites/default/files/GSLS%20GenAI%20Research%20Guidelines%20for%20Students%20and%20SupervisorsGSLS%20GenAI%20Research%20Guidelines.pdf)

## Towards responsible genAI use
I believe that we should demand from the UU community to follow these simple steps when using generative AI tools:

1. Minimize the use of AI tools, as they are (currently) environmentally unfriendly
2. Don't input confidential or personal information
3. Don't input information that violates IP or copyright
4. Don't violate IP with using output from the tool
5. Confirm the output accuracy
6. Check the tool output for bias
7. Disclose the use of AI tools in your work
8. Don't do naughty or unjust things with AI tools
9. Ask the tool not to use input for training
10. Open the content you produce by using AI tools as much as possible with permissive licenses

If in doubt about any of the above, don't use generative AI tools.

For teachers: Put a disclaimer on your materials that governs what is or is not allowed when using generative AI tools.

## When asked for proof of enhanced learning?
1. **Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Sustainable Education**: A systematic review has explored how AI supports sustainable education by changing teaching scenarios to more remote, virtual, and blended formats. It highlights the application of AI in analyzing learning behaviors, performance prediction, and personalized learning interventions. This integration aims for better adaptation to students' real-time learning status and early assistance provision [(source)](https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-023-00260-y).

2. **Adaptive Learning Techniques for Personalized Education**: The study discusses the use of e-TPCK, an adaptive electronic learning environment designed to support the development of student-teachers’ Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) in a personalized manner. The e-TPCK system aims to engage learners in personalized learning experiences, addressing their diverse needs and preferences. [(source)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.789397/full).

3. **Personalized Learning and Academic Assessment**: The University of South Australia has developed learner profiles that provide real-time analysis of a student's learning behaviors and wellbeing. This initiative aims to significantly improve teaching and learning quality by allowing educators to identify and respond to each child's needs promptly. Furthermore, the OnTask project enhances academic experiences by providing personalized feedback and suggestions for better learning experiences.

## Bottomline:

AI is supposed to enhance learning, but the evidence is still scarce. Promises are made about

- personalized learning paths
- adaptive learning
- enhanced writing assistance
- improved motivation
- accessibility to quality education
- support instructors

On top of that:

- AI is supposed to make education more inclusive
  - this is not the case, as the same level of AI is not accessible to all
  - AI itself is not always inclusive, as it can be biased

# How Students and Teachers Use AI output

## Students and Teachers: Expected Uses of AI

We have seen the promises that have been made in the previous section. These promises assume that students and teachers will use AI in a certain way. Do they?

To realize the potential gains, students and teachers are supposed to take an active, knowledge driven approach to AI. This means that they should:

1. engage actively
2. critically evaluate the output
3. use the output to enhance their learning experience

## Reality Check: How AI Tools Are Actually Used

## Some general UU survey results 
- 1633 Students
- 348 Teaching staff
- BA/MA balanced; few pre-master
<br><br>
- 34.4% of teaching staff report not to use GenAl for educational purposes vs. only 13.4% of students
- 68% of students use genAl for working with texts vs. 47% of staff
- Majority of respondents use GenAI for Brainstorming, Text Writing, Clarifying Questions, and Summarizing & Explaining Texts
- Teaching staff use it less for Research Design than students (40% vs. 11.9%)*
- 18.5% of teaching staff report that they use to create study content and 26.9% for demonstration purposes in class


## Some interesting results
- Both students and staff think that the use of GenAI tools for assignments is widespread among students use.
- Lecturers seem to perceive students as not particularly knowledgeable about the use of GenAI 
- Students seem to perceive teachers as not particularly knowledgeable about the use of GenAI
- Lecturers also think that their colleagues are not very knowledgeable about the us of GenAI.
- Students don’t think it’s unethical to use GenAI in course work for support and assistance, or for generating a solution for even a small portion of an assignment. Staff views are a bit more varied, but not exact opposite. 
- There is a huge cry for literacy training in GenAl from both students and staff. 
- 7.1% of teaching staff report that they use it for grading/assessment of work (no significant differences between faculties detected)


# Inputting student data into AI

## Can AI Tools Be Used for Grading?
Sure! I have done that in past, but I did not call it AI

There are a couple of domains where *AI tools* can be very helpful in grading:

1. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
2. Code evaluation and automated testing

The more structured language is, the easier it is for AI to optimize the language. This is very apparant in the field of programming, where AI can be used to generate all sorts of automated evaluations, code optimization, and unit tests. 

## How AES Works

1. Training: AES systems are trained on a dataset of essays that have been graded by human experts. The system learns to recognize the qualities and characteristics that correspond to various grades.

2. Feature Extraction: The AES algorithms analyze essays for a range of features, including grammar, syntax, vocabulary, sentence structure, and sometimes even the coherence and logic of the argument. The sophistication of feature analysis can vary widely among systems.

3. Scoring: Once an essay is submitted, the AES system applies the model it has learned to evaluate the unseen essay's features. It then assigns a score based on its training on previously graded essays.

4. Feedback: Some AES systems can also provide feedback to students, identifying areas for improvement or strengths in their writing.

This is a completely different scenario from entering student work into generative AI tools to generate output for grading student work!

## Cons of AI-Assisted Grading
Much like with AES, there are some limitations and potential drawbacks to using AI tools for grading:

- Language is complex; can contemporary AI fully grasp the nuance that a human grader would pick up?
- Bias in the training data can lead to biased grading outcomes.
- AI tools may struggle with creativity, originality, or unconventional approaches that human graders can appreciate.
- How does AI treat continuation errors in exams? 
- Would you feel satisfied if your work was evaluated by an AI reviewer? Or if an AI would process and respond to your assessment and development portfolio?
- Isn't student work protected by intelectual property and copyright?

As a statistician I can argue that using AI tools for grading opens the door to a class of potential errors that might go unnoticed. 

## Is It a Good Idea to Use AI in Grading?

:::

## Student rights in the AI-Era Classroom

::: {.callout-tip}
## Human contact is a right
Every student has the right to be educated and graded by a human being. That right also includes the right to know a priori to what extend AI is used 

1. in creating the educational materials, 
2. in providing feedback,
3. in grading student work.

Every student has the right to refuse interaction or any other involvement with an AI for their coursework.
:::

## Conclusion

Minimize the use of AI tools, and when you do use them, do so responsibly. 

Generative AI can be a great companion in a knowledge discovery journey, but it is not a replacement for scientific rigor, active reading, critical thinking and human creativity. 

Contemporary AI should always be viewed as a complement to human actions rather than a replacement. 

Be as transparant about the use of AI tools in your work as you would require others to be. Also, make sure that you are not violating any rights or laws. 

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The only way to sustainable embedding of generative AI in academia is to ensure a sense of community and collective ownership of responsible AI practice. 

This requires a shared responsibility that requires the active participation of all involved, whereby we hold ourselves and each other accountable for our actions.
